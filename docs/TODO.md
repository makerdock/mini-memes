## Tech Stack for One-Day MVP
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
- **Canvas Manipulation**: fabric.js (lightweight and easy to implement)
- **Farcaster Integration**: Farcaster Frames SDK
- **Zora Integration**: Zora API with minimal configuration
- **Image Storage**: Vercel Blob Storage (simple setup)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (one-click deployment from GitHub)

## Critical Features vs Nice-to-Have
### Critical (Must Complete)
- Template gallery with selection
- Basic text editing on predefined areas
- Image generation
- Farcaster posting

### Nice-to-Have (Complete if Time Allows)
- Zora minting
- DM delivery
- Additional text customization
- Recently used templates

## Simplified Architecture for MVP
1. **Static Frontend** - Next.js app with client-side rendering
2. **Serverless Functions** - Handle image generation and API integrations
3. **Temporary Storage** - Store generated images briefly
4. **External APIs** - Connect to Farcaster and Zora
